@article{KORN1988,
	abstract = {A statistical comparison is presented of Markov and fractal models of ion channel gating. The analysis is based on single-channel data from two types of ion channels: open times from a 90 pS Ca-activated K channel from GH3 pituitary cells, and closed times from a nonselective channel from rabbit corneal endothelium (Liebovitch et al., 1987a). Maximum likelihood methods were used to fit the data. For both data sets the best Markov model had three exponential components. The best Markov model had a higher likelihood than the fractal model, and the Asymptotic Information Criterion favored the Markov model for each data set. A more detailed analysis, using the Monte Carlo methods described in Horn (1987), showed that the Markov model was not significantly better than the fractal model for the corneal endothelium channels. The inability to discriminate the models definitively in this case was shown to be due in part to the small size of the data set.},

@article{EAST1978,
	abstract = {The conductance changes, gK(t) and gNa(t), of squid giant axon under voltage clamp (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952) may be modeled by exponentiated exponential functions (Gompertz kinetics) from any holding potential VO to any membrane clamp potential V. The equation constants are set by the membrane potential V, and include, for any voltage step in the case of gK, the initial conductance, gO, the asymptote conductance g, and rate constant k: gK = g exp(-be-kt) where b = 1n g/gO. Equations of similar form relate g and k to the voltage V, and govern the corresponding parameters of the gNa system. For the gNa, the fast phase y = y exp (-be-kt) is cut down in proportion to a slow process p = (1 - p)e-k't + p, and thus gNa = py. The expo-exponential functions involve fewer constants than the Hodgkin-Huxley model. In particular, the role of the n, m, h parameters appears to be filled largely by 1n (g/gO) in the case of gK and by 1n (y/yO) in the case of gNa. Membrane action potentials during current clamp may be computed from the conductances generated by use of the appropriate differential forms of the equations; diverse other membrane behaviors may be predicted.},

@article{LIEB1987,
	abstract = {Ion channels have been modeled as consisting of a small number of discrete conformational states such as closed ⇌ closed ⇌ open, and the transitions between the states treated as a Markov process. We derive an alternative model based on a fractal scaling of the kinetic rate constants k, namely that k = At1-D, where t is time, A the kinetic setpoint, and D the fractal dimension. By measuring the effective kinetic rate constants at different time scales, we show how to determine if single channel records are best represented by models with discrete Markov states or continuum fractal kinetics. The fractal model suggests that the multiple closed states postulated by Markov models to fit the histograms of closed times may not exist but are an artifact of trying to fit the sum of exponentials to histograms that are not the sum of exponentials. The fractal model is also more consistent with the conformational dynamics of proteins. Analysis of patch clamp recordings from an epithelium, the corneal endothelium, shows that its channels have fractal rather than Markov kinetics.},

Other sorts of mechanisms may, of course, exist; for example, there may be an irreversible reaction step, a problem that is considered in Section 7. Our primary aim is to gain insight about the nature of the reaction mechanism from experimental observations. In this process, we may also obtain estimates of numerical values for the rate constants in the mechanism.},
